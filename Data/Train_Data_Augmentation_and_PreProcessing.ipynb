The Codrus, therefore by putting aside its royal guides and carrying the dress of a shepherd, has made its way in the field of the enemy, deliberately caused a quarrel and was killed without being recognized.', 'During the first announcement of the death of his uncles, although the centurions of neighboring legions immediately offered their services and those of their men, and Salviienus and Agrippa advised him to accept the offer, it was so in a hurry to Return to the city that it was already in Brundium when he learned the details of the murder and the terms of his uncles will do so.', 'Cato, although he offered the supreme command of the soldiers, preferred to take the orders of Scipio, his superior of rank.', 'You took a few anxious days of Marcus Cicerone, a few years of seni, a life that would have been more miserable in your field than his death was not in your Triumvirate; But you have not stolen her with his fame, the glory of his actions and his words, indeed, but you have improved them.', 'And, after this first warning, it was not time for a second.', 'Let me end my volume with a prayer.', 'A similar fortune participated in a similar attempt by Milo. As he besieged the complete, a city of Hirpini, was struck by a stone, and therefore the agitated man, too reckless to be called courageous, paid the penalty he owed to Pusbus Clodius and his country, against which he brought weapons.', 'This title of Augustus was rightly handed over to him on the Plancus motion with the unanimous applause of the entire Senate and the Roman people.', 'He was in accordance with Caesars Fortune and his mercy that none of those who had brought arms against him were put to death by him or his order.', \"The Roman armies had been sent to these provinces for the first time in the consolation of Scipio and Semponius Lonus, during the first year of the Second Punic War, two hundred and fifty years ago, under the command of Gnaeus Scipio, Africa's uncle. For a period of two hundred years, the struggle was maintained with so many blood effusions on both sides as the Roman people, from the loss of their commanders and armed, often suffered from misfortune, and sometimes their empire was really in hazard.\", 'Cesare, during his victorious return to the city, announced that he intended to put aside for a public use of the houses he had provided for the purchase through his agents so that he can have a free zone in your residence. He also promised to build a temple of Apollo with a portico in this regard, a work which he built with a rare munificence.', 'But this man, innovative of human power, has received a hard blow in the hands of luck at the moment, because most of his fleet has been destroyed and dispersed near Velia and Cape Palinurus by a violent Sirocco.', 'These were the life and death of the children of Tiberio Gracco and the grandchildren of Prabus Scipio Africanus and their mother Cornelia, daughter of Africanus, still lived to attend their end. A sick use that made their excellent talents. If they had not had honors as citizens that citizens could have legally received, the state would have conferred them with peaceful means of everything they tried to obtain with illegal agitations.', 'While the war was waged against Santorius in Spain, sixty-four slaves, under the direction of Spartacus, fleeing a school of gladiators in the Capua, seized the swords of this city and initially took refuge on Mount Vesuve;', 'If someone says that I did everything to mention these men, his criticisms will not meet any denial. At the sight of the honest men of a good franchise without false declaration is not a crime.', 'Consequently, although citizenship has been given to Italy with the condition that new citizens are registered but eight tribes, so that their power and number are not weakened the prestige of older citizens and that the beneficiaries could not Not having a greater power of power of power of benefactors, Cinna has now promised to distribute them in all the tribes. With this object, he had gathered a great multitude in the city of all regions of Italy.', 'One might think that on the opinion in Italy, not as a champion of the war, but as a peace institute, therefore silently guided his army through the Calabria and the Puglia in Campania, taking care Unusual so as not to inflict damage, fields, men, or city, and these efforts have made war on simple terms and good conditions. But peace could not be for the taste of men whose cause was evil and whose greed was unlimited.', 'And so, as a final protection measure, the state asked Auguste that Tiberius should have waged war.', 'In the end, he was prevailed rather for the honor than for honor, because he saw that everything that did not commit to protecting was likely that he perished. He is the only man who fell to refuse the principality longer, almost how many others had fought to assure him.', 'Decimus brutus, abandoned for the first time by plancus, and later in reality, the object of his plots, gradually abandoned by his army, and now fleeting, was killed by the emissaries of Antonio in the house of a noble Appointed Camelus with whom he had taken refuge. . He then met his right deserts and paid the penalty of his betrayal to Gaius César from which he had been so well treated. The one who had been the principal of all the friends of Caesars became his killer, and although he launched the hateful responsibility of luck with which he had perceived the advantages himself, he thought it was right to keep What he had received in the hands of the hands of the Caesars and for Cesare, which had given everything, to perish.', 'A detail, however, I cannot abstain to note. When Gaius Cesar saw that the army pumps had been defeated, he made his first concern to send orders to grant a quarter if I could use the usual military expression.', 'It is certainly not to die, but rather to joyfully spending life.', \"If his death was due to natural causes as most people think, or if it was the result of a plot, as some historians say, the life he lived was in any case so crowded with honors that 'He has so far passed brilliantly by person except only his grandson.\", 'But, in the case of Sosius, it was the promised word of Lucius Arutius, a man famous for his old dignity, who saved him; Later, Caesar preserved it unknown, but only after having long resisted its general inclination to the Clemence.', 'All these acts were now included in the decrees of the Senate and officially ratified. Decimus brutus was elected for a triumph, probably because, thanks to the services of others, he had fled his life. Hiritirus and Pansa were honored by public funerals. Of Cesare has not been said a word. The Senate even reached the point of instructing its envoys, which had been sent to the army of Caesars, to confer only the soldiers, without the presence of their general.', 'Césare therefore walked with his army in Tessaglia, intended to be the scene of his victory.', \"Bibulus, colleague from Caesars, with the intention rather than the power to hinder Caesars' acts, limited himself to his home during most of the year.\", 'Subsequently, all Ahaia was excited in the war, although most was crushed, as I have already said, by the value and weapons of this same Metello macedonicus. The Corinthians, in particular, were the instigators, reaching the point of accumulating serious insults on the Romans and Mumrius, the console, was appointed to take charge of the war there.', \"He was jumped by a noble family, the sixth descent of Cornelius Rufinus who had been one of the famous generals of the war with Pyrro. Since his family's fame had decreased, he played for a long time as if he had not thought of seeking consolation.\", 'Cicero seemed to have turned on their resentment by refusing to be a member of the commission of twenty accused of the distribution of the land of Campania.', 'Lepido himself paid the penalty for his reckless plot.', 'Since then, at the arrival of Caesars in Egypt, they attacked him with plots and then dared to challenge him in an open war. By suffering from death, they paid for these two large commanders, the living and the dead, a deserved expiation.', 'The state quickly collected the fruit of its test in the desired tiberius, and it was not long before what we should have been finished if our request had been refused and what we had won for granted.')\n"

the body and more used to the leisure time of the field than in real service at war. the fact that it was not a contempt for money is demonstrated by his governor of syria: a poor man entered the province, but he left him a rich man and the poor province. when he was in charge of the army in germany, he entertained the idea that the germans were a people who were only men in the arts and the voice and that they could not be submitted by the sword, could be calmed by law.   \n8635
